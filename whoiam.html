        <h2>Who I am?</h2>
        <p class="text">I have loved logic and math for all my life. I'm from a teachers family, son of a Math teacher, nephew of Physics professor and grandson of Portuguese professors. I have passed all my life at school, literally, since the time I woke up, until bedtime. Maybe my passion for learning comes from that. I learn naturally and I love to solve big issues, even under pressure. I face the difficulty as part of the process, like if the normal was to be hard. No time for complaint.</p>
